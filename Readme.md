TabulaTiME: Spatiotemporal analysis of the integrated pan-cancer landscapes reveals the driver cell type
Tumor microenvironment (TME) evolves during malignant cell recruiting and reprograming the non-cancerous cells and remodeling the vasculature and extracellular matrix (ECM) to orchestrate a tumor-supportive environment. The composition and functional state of TME can vary considerably between the organ in which the tumor arises, due to the unique tissue-resident cells. Here, we collected the expression of 4,254,586 cells from 735 patient samples across 36 cancer types, and construct a pan-cancer landscape to depict the diversity of TMEs.
